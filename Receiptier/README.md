#### Description:
1. RECEIPTIER <BACKGROUND>
	- What is RECIEPTER? it is an android app
	- Why is it needed? To keep track of user's spending habits.
	  (At home <When buying stuff online> or outside <when buying stuff at malls and such>.)
     - Advantages: Avoid losing any information regarding money.

2. Technology
	- Why JAVA instead of languages learnt in cs50. < Well documentation and used by most app-developers >
		- JAVA is Object Oriented Programming.
		- It is one of the most popular language in programming.
		- Able to use third party packages to improve product versatility.
		  Java is a popular programming language that has been used to develop a wide range of applications, including mobile applications. In fact, Java is often considered one of the best programming
		  languages for mobile application development due to a number of reasons. In this article, we will explore some of the key reasons why Java is better for writing mobile applications.

			Platform Independence
			One of the key benefits of Java is its platform independence. Java code can be compiled into bytecode that can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This means that Java applications can run on different platforms without requiring any modifications to the code. This is particularly useful for mobile application development, where developers need to target multiple operating systems.

			Huge Developer Community
			Java has a large and active developer community that is constantly working on improving the language and developing new tools and libraries. This means that there is a vast pool of resources available to developers who are working on mobile applications. From tutorials and documentation to forums and support groups, Java developers have access to a wealth of information that can help them build better applications faster.

			Rich Set of Libraries and Frameworks
			Java has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that can help developers build mobile applications quickly and easily. These libraries and frameworks provide pre-written code that can be reused in different applications, which can save developers a lot of time and effort. Some popular Java libraries and frameworks for mobile application development include Spring, Hibernate, and Struts.

			Security
			Security is a critical aspect of mobile application development, and Java is known for its robust security features. Java applications are run inside a sandbox environment that prevents them from accessing sensitive data or resources on the user's device. Additionally, Java provides features like automatic memory management and exception handling that can help prevent security vulnerabilities in applications.

			Performance
			Java is a high-performance language that can handle large volumes of data and complex computations with ease. This makes it an ideal choice for mobile applications that require fast processing and data handling. Java applications can be optimized for performance using a range of techniques, such as caching, lazy loading, and multithreading.

			Scalability
			Java is a highly scalable language that can be used to build applications of any size, from small mobile applications to large enterprise systems. This makes it an ideal choice for businesses that want to develop mobile applications that can grow and evolve over time. Java applications can be easily scaled up or down based on changing requirements, without requiring significant changes to the code.

			In conclusion, Java is a powerful programming language that is well-suited for mobile application development. Its platform independence, large developer community, rich set of libraries and frameworks, security features, performance, and scalability make it an ideal choice for businesses that want to build high-quality mobile applications that can run on different platforms and devices.

3. APP
	- Everyone has a smart mobile device, but not everyone owns a PC.
	- Portable
	- Usually simple and user friendly

4. FUNCTIONALITY
	- Recieve data via camera or photo-library
	- Store data in database via *SQL*
		- Receipts can be stored in different profiles i.e. profile1, 2, ... <See simulator>
		- data can be stored for as long as user likes. Thus, he can monitor his progress for a long period of time.
5. FUTURE WORKS
	- CHART DATA < easily interpreted data i.e. spending-time(weekly/monthly/yearly)>
	- IMPLEMENT CATEGORIES < i.e. GROCERY, LEISTURE, FAMILY, FRIENDS ... >
	- SHARE DATA < Social media >


F.I.N. SELF OBSERVATION: After using this app for 2weeks, i realised that my spending habits has decreased by 20%.
	   - first week, spent $200
 	   - Second week, spent $160
	   ACHIEVED PROOF OF CONCEPT
	   		- Takeaways:
				Advantage: App allows users understand how their money is spent ( More awareness )
				Dis-advantage: User has to keep up the habit of using the app and store data from receipts

App details:

The one stop solution to manage your receipt and help you keep track of your spending habits and perhaps help you save money more!

Receipt:
Can either upload your receipt image or manually key in your merchant and spent value

History:
Keep track of how much you spent between specific dates

Users:
Manage your profile here by creating or delete profile
